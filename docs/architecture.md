# Architecture

## Purpose

RocotoActor isolates each actor in its own operating-system process. The extra
processes and threads are intentional: a blocked actor must not block the
application or unrelated actors. The library is designed for a handful of
long-lived actors, not thousands of short-lived actors.

`RocotoActor::ActorBroker` is the only component that creates actors. Public
code receives opaque `ActorHandle` values; sockets, processes, and
`Reference` objects remain private to the application process.

## Process model

Each actor has this physical structure:

```text
application
  ActorBroker
    Reference
      Unix socket
      reader thread
      writer thread
      reaper thread
    watchdog process (process-group leader)
      actor worker process
      actor-created descendants
```

The watchdog kills its process group when the application or worker exits.
The broker owns restart and hierarchy policy; the watchdog only provides
process containment.

Actor parent/child relationships are logical broker metadata. Every watchdog
is a direct child of the application, so cross-branch communication and
lifecycle ownership remain centralized.

## Component responsibilities

### `ActorBroker`

Owns the logical actor registry and all cross-actor policy:

- actor paths, parents, children, states, and generations
- brokered calls and tells
- route limits, deadlines, and synchronous-call deadlock detection
- child spawning and recursive stopping
- restart policy
- watches and application lifecycle events
- actor-owned timers
- the process-limit preflight before every launch (`ProcessBudget`)

The broker has one mutex protecting this state. It never calls a `Reference`
method that takes the reference mutex while holding the broker mutex.

Mechanical broker concurrency is delegated to three private executors:

- `EventDispatcher` owns watcher IDs, ordered event delivery, and the event
  thread.
- `DeadlineScheduler` owns route expirations, delayed tasks, and the service
  thread.
- `LifecycleExecutor` owns bounded blocking spawn/stop/relaunch jobs and its
  worker pool.

These executors do not own actor state. They invoke broker callbacks after
releasing their own queue locks; `ActorBroker` remains the policy and state
owner.

`broker.rb` is organized by concern, with `# ===` section banners and a
reading guide above the class that maps them; start there rather than at the
top of the file.

### `Reference`

Owns one actor connection and process group:

- bounded outbound mailbox
- request IDs and pending futures
- socket reader and writer threads
- process reaping and forced termination
- broker responses sent back to the actor

All mutable connection state is protected by one reference mutex. Callbacks
run after that mutex is released.

A connection has one phase that only moves forward:
`open` (accepts requests) → `draining` (a graceful stop is in flight) →
`terminating` (nothing more is written; pending futures are rejected) →
`exited` (the watchdog process was reaped) → `gone` (the process group is
confirmed absent). `enter(phase)` performs the shared shutdown work once;
`kill`, `close_and_reap`, and `actor_exited` differ only in whether they kill
the group and whether they wait for the reader to drain the watchdog's exit
report.

### `Launcher` and `Runner`

`Launcher` creates the socket pair, watchdog process, and parent-side
`Reference`. `Runner` is the child entry point: it forks the actor worker,
loads the actor source, constructs the actor, and executes one message at a
time. The watchdog observes both the worker and application.

### `BrokerClient`, `ActorContext`, and handles

Inside a worker, one `BrokerClient` serializes broker requests over the
actor's existing socket. `ActorContext` exposes child spawning, watching, and
self-scheduling. `ActorHandle` and `Timer` are opaque IDs bound either to the
application broker or to the worker's broker client.

`DecodeBindings` explicitly tells `Transport` how to bind decoded handles and
timers. Each `Reference` owns broker bindings created before its reader starts;
each worker `BrokerClient` owns socket bindings for that incarnation. This is
separate from `ActorContext` and uses no thread-local state.

No socket descriptor or `Reference` crosses an actor boundary.

### `Transport` and `Future`

`Protocol` defines operation names and constructs request, success, failure,
and broker-response envelopes. `Transport` implements length-prefixed tagged
JSON with frame, type, cycle, and nesting validation. `Future` provides a
single permanent result, error, or timeout and invokes resolution callbacks
outside its mutex.

## Threads owned by the broker

- **Deadline scheduler thread:** route expirations, timer firing, delayed restart
  work.
- **Lifecycle executor pool:** blocking child spawn/stop and relaunch
  operations.
- **Event dispatcher thread:** ordered application callbacks and watch
  notifications.

These remain separate because service deadlines must not be delayed by
blocking lifecycle operations or slow event consumers. The scheduler and event
threads start with the broker; `ActorBroker.new` raises `ResourceLimitError`
if they cannot be created. Lifecycle workers and the per-actor reader, writer,
and reaper threads are created on demand.

There is no degraded mode for a thread that cannot be created later
(`RLIMIT_NPROC`), because the broker never needs one: its scheduler thread,
event thread, and first lifecycle worker are created by `ActorBroker.new`,
which raises `ResourceLimitError` if any cannot be, and that first worker
lives until `stop`, so internal work that owns actor state (`stop_later`,
`relaunch`) can always be queued. Further lifecycle workers are optional; one
that cannot be created only leaves the pool smaller. Every thread is created
through `Threads.start`, which turns the `ThreadError` into
`ResourceLimitError` at the creation site, so a `ThreadError` from lock
misuse elsewhere is never mistaken for one. A new actor's threads failing is
that launch's problem: `Launcher.launch` raises `ResourceLimitError` to the
spawner, or to `relaunch`, which counts it as a failure, exactly as the
preflight's refusal is handled. `broker.stop` closes the event queue before
retiring actors, so a shutdown emits no events; it also confirms the exit of
processes a failed boot killed without waiting.

All four broker threads report through `ErrorReporting`: every exception a
callback raises goes to `error_handler`, and none of them, nor anything the
handler raises, ends the thread.

## Lock and callback rules

1. The broker mutex is never held while entering a `Reference` method that can
   take the reference mutex.
2. A `Reference` never calls the broker while holding its mutex.
3. `Future#on_resolve`, `Reference#on_exit`, and broker-response completion
   callbacks run outside locks.
4. Node state, generation, reference replacement, and hierarchy mutations are
   atomic under the broker mutex.
5. Blocking socket I/O belongs only to per-actor reader or writer threads.

See [REVIEW.md](../REVIEW.md) for the complete concurrency invariants and
interleavings that reviews must preserve.

## Delivery and failure semantics

- Delivery is at-most-once; the library never retries messages.
- A failed call can have an ambiguous side-effect outcome.
- Application protocols own idempotency and deduplication.
- Requests queued or executing when an incarnation dies are rejected and are
  never replayed after restart.
- Handles remain stable across restart; the broker changes their current
  generation and `Reference` binding.
- A logical child never outlives its parent.

## Validation

Run the normal quality gate with:

```sh
bundle exec rake
```

The soak and Linux fault-matrix harnesses exercise longer-running and
platform-specific behavior. Their commands and accepted limitations are in
[linux-validation.md](linux-validation.md).

The chronological design, review, and validation record remains in
[actor-broker-handoff.md](actor-broker-handoff.md). It is useful when tracing
why a decision was made, but this document is the starting point for the
current architecture.
